# Creating Anything at all For Fun
## Hi ya👋,how are you today??

So really,I don't knkw what to do and that's why I created this repo and anything you see in here.
I'm more or less bored and that is exactly why the title of my page is:

```html
<title>Stressed and Bored</title>
```

Lol, I forgot to add that I'm equally stressed at the moment.
Anyways, I really don't have anything at all right now in mind of creating,but I'm sure something will turn up. I started with adding a Twitter like splash screen, let's see how far that goes.

## Recent Update
So the Twitter page is looking good, Injust added a top sectioj just like twitter, added a twitter icon there on the top and added my twitter profile picture.

Hopefully I can get more done before my battery runs out LoL 😅, I've got 6% on battery life.

I'll keep updating this until I'm done 😉
